# WeFixIt-Repair
A front-end responsive site developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; as an early project. The testimonial slider utilized <a href="https://swiperjs.com/" target="_blank">Swiper</a>. 

Swiper is a cutting-edge free mobile touch slider with incredible native behavior and hardware-accelerated transitions. It is designed to be utilized in mobile web applications, native and hybrid mobile apps, as well as mobile webpages.

WeFixIt is a website created for a fictitious Digital Repair business. This was one of my earliest projects, completed when I was still learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
